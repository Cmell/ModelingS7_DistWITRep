It is important to know that the faces will either be Black in race or White. People often show racial bias on the task, responding better to guns after Black faces than after White faces. However, there is no correlation between the race of face and the object that will appear. As a result, the best strategy is to ignore the race of the face. Try not to show racial bias! Do NOT let the face influence your decision!

Remember, try to avoid biased responding by <b>ignoring the face!</b> Half of the Black faces will be followed by guns, as will half of the White faces.
